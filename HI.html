    <h2 style="color:black;font-size:40px;">What is Sustainable Development?</h2>      
    <p style="color:black;font-size:25px;">Sustainable development is an organizing principle 
    <BR>for meeting human development goals while also sustaining the ability of natural systems 
    <BR>to provide the natural resources and ecosystem services on which the economy and society depend
    <BR>The desired result is a state of society where living conditions and resources are used to continue
    <BR>to meet human needs without undermining the integrity and stability of the natural system. 
    <BR>Sustainable development can be defined as development that meets the needs of the present 
    <BR>generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.</p>

    <p style="color:black;font-size:25px;">According to the UN, The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the world shared plan to
    <BR> end severe poverty, reduce inequality, and protect the planet by 2030.

    <h4 style="color:black;font-size:40px;">Development of the concept</h4>      
    <p style="color:black;font-size:25px;">Sustainable development has its roots in ideas about sustainable forest management, 
    <BR>which were developed in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries.In response to a growing awareness of 
    <BR>the depletion of timber resources in England, John Evelyn argued, in his 1662 essay Sylva, that 
    <BR>"sowing and planting of trees had to be regarded as a national duty of every landowner, 
    <BR>in order to stop the destructive over-exploitation of natural resources." In 1713, 
    <BR>Hans Carl von Carlowitz, a senior mining administrator in the service of Elector 
    <BR>Frederick Augustus I of Saxony published Sylvicultura economics, a 400-page work on forestry. Building upon the ideas 
    <BR>of Evelyn and French minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert, von Carlowitz developed the concept of managing 
    <BR>forests for sustained yield. His work influenced others, including Alexander 
    <BR>von Humboldt and Georg Ludwig Hartig, eventually leading to the development of the science of forestry.
    <BR> This, in turn, influenced people like Gifford Pinchot, the first head of the US Forest Service, 
    <BR>whose approach to forest management was driven by the idea of wise use of resources, and Aldo 
    <BR>Leopold whose land ethic was influential in the development of the environmental movement in the 1960s.
    <BR>Following the publication of Rachel Carson's Silent Spring in 1962, the developing environmental 
    <BR>movement drew attention to the relationship between economic growth and environmental degradation. 
    <BR>Kenneth E. Boulding, in his influential 1966 essay The Economics of the Coming 
    <BR>Spaceship Earth, identified the need for the economic system to fit itself to the 
    <BR>ecological system with its limited pools of resources. Another milestone was the 1968 article by 
    <BR>Garrett Hardin that popularized the term "tragedy of the commons". One of the first uses of the term 
    <BR>sustainable in the contemporary sense was by the Club of Rome in 1972 in its classic report on the 
    <BR>Limits to Growth, written by a group of scientists led by Dennis and Donella Meadows of the Massachusetts 
    <BR>Institute of Technology. Describing the desirable "state of global equilibrium", 
    <BR>the authors wrote: "We are searching for a model output that represents a world system that is 
    <BR>sustainable without sudden and uncontrolled collapse and capableof satisfying the basic material 
    <BR>requirements of all of its people. That year also saw the publication of the influential A Blueprint for Survival book.
    <BR>In 1975, an MIT research group prepared ten days of hearings on 
    <BR>"Growth and Its Implication for the Future" for the US Congress, the first 
    <BR>hearings ever held on sustainable development.
    <BR>In 1980, the International Union for Conservation of Nature published a world conservation strategy 
    <BR>that included one of the first references to sustainable development as a global priority and 
    <BR>introduced the term "sustainable development".â€Š Two years later, the United Nations World 
    <BR>Charter for Nature raised five principles of conservation by which human conduct affecting 
    <BR>nature is to be guided and judged.

    <h5 style="color:black;font-size:40px;">Dimentions</h5>      
    <p style="color:black;font-size:25px;">Sustainable development, like sustainability, is regarded
     <BR>to have three dimensions (also called pillars, domains, aspects, spheres etc.): the environment, 
    <BR>economy and society. This framework has been expanded by some authors to include a fourth 
    <BR>pillar of culture, institutions or governance.

    <h6 style="color:black;font-size:40px;">Critique</h6>      
    <p style="color:black;font-size:25px;"> The concept of sustainable development has been, and still is, 
    <BR>subject to criticism, including the question of what is to be sustained in sustainable development. 
    <BR>It has been argued that there is no such thing as a sustainable use of a non-renewable resource, since any 
    <BR>positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to the exhaustion of earth's finite stock
    <BR>this perspective renders the Industrial Revolution as a whole unsustainable.
    <BR>The sustainable development debate is based on the assumption that societies need to manage three types 
    <BR>of capital (economic, social, and natural), which may be non-substitutable and whose consumption might be 
    <BR>irreversible. Natural capital can not necessarily be substituted by economic capital. 
    <BR>While it is possible that we can find ways to replace some natural resources, it is much less likely that 
    <BR>they will ever be able to replace ecosystem services, such as the protection provided by the ozone layer, 
    <BR>or the climate stabilizing function of the Amazonian forest.
    <BR>The concept of sustainable development has been criticized from different angles. 
    <BR>While some see it as paradoxical (or an oxymoron) and regard development as 
    <BR>inherently unsustainable, others are disappointed in the lack of progress that has been achieved so far.
    <BR>The Rio Protocol was a huge leap forward: for the first time, the world agreed on a 
    <BR>sustainability agenda. In fact, a global consensus was facilitated by neglecting concrete goals and 
    <BR>operational details. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) now have concrete targets 
    <BR>(unlike the results from the Rio Process) but no methods for sanctions
