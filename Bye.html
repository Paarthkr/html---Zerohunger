<h2 style="color:black;font-size:40px;">What is Zero hunger?</h2>      
<p style="color:black;font-size:25px;">Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2 or Global Goal 2) aims to achieve "zero hunger". 
<BR>It is one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations in 2015. The official wording is: 
<BR>"End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture".
<BR>SDG 2 highlights the complex inter-linkages between food security, nutrition, rural transformation and sustainable agriculture. 
<BR>According to the United Nations, there are around 690 million people who are hungry, which accounts for slightly less 
<BR>than 10 percent of the world population. One in every nine people goes to bed hungry each night, 
<BR>including 20 million people currently at risk of famine in South Sudan, Somalia, Yemen and Nigeria.
<BR>SDG 2 has eight targets and 14 indicators to measure progress. The five "outcome targets" are:
<BR>ending hunger and improving access to food; ending all forms of malnutrition; agricultural productivity; 
<BR>sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices; and genetic diversity of seeds, 
<BR>cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals; investments, research and technology. The three 
<BR>"means of achieving" targets include: addressing trade restrictions and distortions in world agricultural 
<BR>markets and food commodity markets and their derivatives.
<BR>Under-nutrition has been on the rise since 2015, after falling for decades. This majorly results 
<BR>from the various stresses in food systems that include; climate shocks, the locust crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. 
<BR>Those threats indirectly reduce the purchasing power and the capacity to produce and distribute food, which affects the 
<BR>most vulnerable populations and furthermore has reduced their accessibility to food. Up to 142 million people in 2020, 
<BR>have suffered from undernourishment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Stunting and wasting children statistics are 
<BR>likely to worsen with the pandemic. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic "may add between 83 and 132 million people to the
<BR>total number of undernourished in the world by the end of 2020 depending on the economic growth scenario"

<h3 style="color:black;font-size:40px;">What is the backgorund of zero hunger</h3>      
<p style="color:black;font-size:25px;">In September 2015, the General Assembly adopted the 
<BR>2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that included 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
<BR>Building on the principle of "leaving no one behind", the new Agenda emphasizes a holistic 
<BR>approach to achieving sustainable development for all. In September 2019, Heads of State 
<BR>and Government came together during the SDG Summit to renew their commitment to implement 
<BR>the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. During this event, they acknowledged that the 
<BR>first four years of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda included major progress, but that
<BR>overall, the world is not on track to deliver the SDGs. This is when "the decade of action" 
<BR>and "delivery for sustainable development" was launched, demanding stakeholders to speed up 
<BR>the process and efforts of implementation.
<BR>SDG 2 aims to end all forms of malnutrition and hunger by 2030 and ensure that everyone has 
<BR>sufficient food throughout the year, especially children. Chronic malnutrition, which affects
<BR>an estimated 155 million children worldwide, also stunts children's brain and physical 
<BR>development and puts them at further risk of death, disease, and lack of success as adults.
<BR>As of 2017, only 26 of 202 UN member countries were on track to meet the SDG target to 
<BR>eliminate undernourishment and malnourishment, while 20 percent have made no progress 
<BR>at all and nearly 70 percent have no or insufficient data to determine their progress. 
<BR>"There is less than enough food produced today to feed every last one of us." According 
<BR>to FAO, there are almost 690 million people who remain chronically undernourished. 
<BR>This number has dropped by almost half in the past two decades because of rapid economic 
<BR>growth and increased agricultural productivity.
<BR>Malnutrition and extreme hunger constitute a crucial barrier to sustainable development. 
<BR>Both create a trap from which people cannot escape. Hungry people are less productive 
<BR>and easily prone to diseases. As such, they will be unable to improve their livelihood

<h4 style="color:black;font-size:40px;">Development of the concept</h4>      
<p style="color:black;font-size:25px;">The UN has defined 8 targets and 
<BR>13 indicators for SDG 2. Four of them are to be achieved by the year 2030,
<BR>one by the year 2020 and three have no target years. Each of the targets 
<BR>also has one or more indicators to measure progress. In total there are
<BR>fourteen indicators for SDG 2. The six targets include ending hunger and
<BR>increasing access to food (2.1), ending all forms of malnutrition (2.2),
<BR>agricultural productivity (2.3), sustainable food production systems 
<BR>and resilient agricultural practices (2.4), genetic diversity of seeds, 
<BR>cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals (2.5), investments, 
<BR>research and technology (2.a), trade restrictions and distortions in world 
<BR>agricultural markets (2.b) and food commodity markets and their derivatives (2.c).

<ul>
  <li>Universal access to safe and nutritious food</li>
  <li>End all forms of malnutrition</li>
  <li>Double the productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers</li>
  <li>Sustainable food production and resilient agricultural practices</li>
  <li>Maintain the genetic diversity in food production</li>
  <li>Invest in rural infrastructure, agricultural research, technology and gene bank</li>
  <li>Prevent agricultural trade restrictions, market distortions and export subsidies</li>
  <li>Ensure stable food commodity markets and timely access to information</li>
</ul>

<h5 style="color:black;font-size:40px;">Tools</h5>      
<p style="color:black;font-size:25px;">The Global Hunger Index (GHI)
<BR>
<BR>The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is a tool designed to measure and 
<BR>track hunger at global, regional, and national levels.
<BR>Each year, GHI scores are calculated to track progress and setbacks 
<BR>in fighting hunger. The GHI is designed to raise awareness and 
<BR>understanding of the struggle against hunger. It provides a way to 
<BR>compare levels of hunger between countries and regions. It calls 
<BR>attention to areas of the world where hunger levels are highest and 
<BR>where additional efforts are needed to eliminate hunger.

<BR>
<BR>

<BR>The FAO Food Price Index (FFPI)
<BR>
<BR>The FAO Food Price Index (FFPI) is a measure of the monthly 
<BR>change in international prices of a basket of food commodities.
<BR>Monitoring of food prices is provided by publicly available 
<BR>sources including food price index (FAO-FPI): 
<BR>monitoring prices monthly, with trends analysed 
<BR>biannually by the Food Outlook publication; reporting 
<BR>on food import bills is provided quarterly by the Crop 
<BR>Prospects and Food Situation publication, and quarterly 
<BR>WFP Global Market Monitor: reporting on price trends of 
<BR>staple commodities in approximately 70 countries and 
<BR>monthly country-specific market bulletins.
<BR>The GIEWS Food Price Monitoring and Analysis (FPMA)
<BR>provides an analysis of domestic price trends of basic 
<BR>foods at global level and latest food market policy developments 
<BR>as well as early warnings on exceptionally high food prices at the 
<BR>country level that may negatively affect food security.

<h6 style="color:black;font-size:40px;">Overall progress and challenges</h6>      
<p style="color:black;font-size:25px;">Despite the progress, research 
<BR>shows that more than 790 million people worldwide still suffer from hunger. 
<BR>There has been major progress in the fight against hunger over the last 15 years. 
<BR>In 2017, during a side event at the High-Level Political Forum under the theme 
<BR>of "Accelerating progress towards achieving SDG 2: Lessons from national implementation", 
<BR>a series of recommendations and actions were discussed. Stakeholders like the French UN 
<BR>mission, Action Against Hunger, Save The Children and Global Citizen were steering 
<BR>the conversation. It is unlikely there will be an end to malnutrition on the African continent by 2030.
<BR>To achieve progress towards SDG 2 the world needs to build political will and country ownership. 
<BR>It also needs to improve the narrative around nutrition to make sure that 
<BR>it is well understood by political leaders and address gender inequality, 
<BR>geographic inequality and absolute poverty. It also calls for concrete 
<BR>actions including working at sub-national levels, increasing nutrition 
<BR>funding and ensuring they target the first 1000 days of life and going 
<BR>beyond actions that address only the immediate causes of malnutrition 
<BR>and look at the drivers of under-nutrition, as well as at the food 
<BR>system as a whole.

<h7 style="color:black;font-size:40px;">Links with other SDGs</h7>      
<p style="color:black;font-size:25px;">The SDGs are deeply interconnected. 
<BR>All goals could be affected if progress on one specific goal is not achieved.
<BR>Climate change and natural disasters are affecting food security. 
<BR>Disaster risk management, climate change adaptation and mitigation 
<BR>are essential to increase harvests quality and quantity. 
<BR>Targets 2.4 and 2.5 are directly linked to the environment.
<BR>Reducing hunger can directly help in advancing Goals SDG 1, 
<BR>SDG 3 and SDG 8 by increasing rural and developing country 
<BR>incomes and access to nutrition. Since a significant number 
<BR>of farmers, especially in Africa and Asia, are women, advancing 
<BR>SDG 2 can also impact SDG 5, gender equality. Hunger and 
<BR>Agriculture are also linked to SDG 6 (when dealing with water 
<BR>scarcity and pollution), SDG 13 (when discussing greenhouse gas emissions) 
<BR>and SDG 15 (since it is linked to soil degradation).
